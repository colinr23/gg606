You will be introduced to data science through the lens of exploratory data analysis, beginning with the Explore section of the textbook, read and work through the following chapters: W&amp;G - Introduction W&amp;G - Data visualization W&amp;G - Data Transformation W&amp;G - Workflow: basics W&amp;G - Workflow: scripts W&amp;G - Workflow: projects 2.1.2 Excercise Review Data Visualization: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Workflow: basics: 1 2.2 i/o 2.2.1 Reading This week will cover the surprisingly important topic of data i/o - that is, data importing and outputting data. In the Wrangle section of the textbook, read and work through the following chapters: JHDSc - Data import W&amp;G - Tidy data As well as the paper describing the tidy approach to data, published in the Journal of Statistical Software. R documentation - Review of Data Import/Export Data sources and formats vary widely in environmental data analytics. Data acquisition is the steps taken to access and load data for your own analysis. In a classic analysis workflow architecture, data are downloaded to a local working computer and interact with software installed there to complete your analysis. Raw data almost always has to be processed in different ways to make it useful. This can in include Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) steps such as checking and removing duplicate records, cleaning out special characters from text, to things like date formatting and computing derived variables. Having a consistent way to generate data transformations is a cornerstone of reproducible research and modern scientific data workflows. This is one of the key reasons scripting has become so important to environmental data analytics. The tidy approach to data science aims to provide a cohesive and consistent approach to data organization in r. 2.3 Data objects 2.3.1 Reading We will cover some more basic elements of the R programming language - both at the base and more modern levels. At some point having an understanding of how R works at a deeper level becomes necessary to get the most out of it and develop effective analysis and visualization approaches.
