It is estimated that ‘data wrangling’ - cleaning, loading, processing, integrating their data comprises at least half of a data scientist’s time, and that may be even higher in the context of environmental data science.

["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Wrangling 2.1 Data Science Workflows 2.2 i/o", " Chapter 2 Wrangling 2.1 Data Science Workflows 2.1.1 Reading This week will provide an introduction to data science using r. You will be introduced to data science through the lens of exploratory data analysis, beginning with the Explore section of the textbook, read and work through the following chapters: W&amp;G - Introduction W&amp;G - Data visualization W&amp;G - Data Transformation W&amp;G - Workflow: basics W&amp;G - Workflow: scripts W&amp;G - Workflow: projects 2.1.2 Excercise Review Data Visualization: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Workflow: basics: 1 2.2 i/o 2.2.1 Reading This week will cover the surprisingly important topic of data i/o - that is, data importing and outputting data. In the Wrangle section of the textbook, read and work through the following chapters: JHDSc - Data import W&amp;G - Tidy data As well as the paper describing the tidy approach to data, published in the Journal of Statistical Software. R documentation - Review of Data Import/Export Data sources and formats vary widely in environmental data analytics. Data acquisition is the steps taken to access and load data for your own analysis. In a classic analysis workflow architecture, data are downloaded to a local working computer and interact with software installed there to complete your analysis. Raw data almost always has to be processed in different ways to make it useful. This can in include Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) steps such as checking and removing duplicate records, cleaning out special characters from text, to things like date formatting and computing derived variables. Having a consistent way to generate data transformations is a cornerstone of reproducible research and modern scientific data workflows. This is one of the key reasons scripting has become so important to environmental data analytics. The tidy approach to data science aims to provide a cohesive and consistent approach to data organization in r. "],

["assignments.html", "Chapter 4 Assignments 4.1 Assignment 1 - Importing, parsing, and querying data in the wild", " Chapter 4 Assignments 4.1 Assignment 1 - Importing, parsing, and querying data in the wild Your objective in this assignment is to read in, clean, and process a dataset. The due date of this assignment has shifted to Feb 10. 4.1.1 Dataset The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur worldwide and disseminates this information immediately to national and international agencies, scientists, critical facilities, and the general public. The NEIC compiles and provides to scientists and to the public an extensive seismic database that serves as a foundation for scientific research through the operation of modern digital national and global seismograph networks and cooperative international agreements. The NEIC is the national data center and archive for earthquake information. This dataset includes a record of the date, time, location, depth, magnitude, and source of every earthquake with a reported magnitude 5.5 or higher since 1965. You have to structure your assignment as a r mardown file. Watch this video (~45 mins) to learn how to start and navigate markdown files in R-Studio. Disclaimer: I am not endorsing buying these courses - this is just a straightforward introduction to get up to up and running with R-markdown. You can use the following as a template [download to your working directory, and open in R-studio to edit/knit] to get you started for your assignment. Your assignment should answer the following questions and be as reproducible as you can make it (i.e., I should be able to reproduce your answers).This means that you must read data in from a URL so that I can replicate your work, do not include any external data files in your submission, only submit one .Rmd file. You can use external data to supplement your anlayses if you want to. For each answer provide a short write up explaining the approach you took to the question. There are not necessarily correct answers, and I expect your answers to vary from classmates, however you should be able to provide a clear illustration via your code of how you arrived at the conclusion you did. 4.1.2 Questions Read the data in and clean it for analysis, used the readr package functions for reading and parsing data. [5 marks] Did more earthquakes happen on weekends or weekdays? [5 marks] Has there been any change in the frequency of earthquakes? [5 marks] What had more earthquakes in the 1980s, South America or North America? [5 marks] Has there been any geographic shifts in the distribution of earthquakes? [10 marks] 4.1.3 Submission Submit via email to Colin at the start of class on Feb 10 "],
